# PR Check - WIP

This will be a plugin for writing custom rules for providing comments and checks during PR reviews.

Use cases:
 - remind developer to take special care when DB migrations are present
 - add tags to the PR based on changes under a directory or in a file
 - ensure doc files (.md, .adoc, .txt) are all under a specific directory
